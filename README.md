# ClipboardCleaner
Tool that locates itself in Windows' Systemtray and does nothing execpt clearing the clipboard if clicked.

This is somewhat deprecated because Microsoft decided to introduce the Clipboard-App (with History) in the last Windows 10 build. 

This has the functionality of this program somewhat inside of it.
